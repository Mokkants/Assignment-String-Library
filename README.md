This code is created for the very first assignment for the SEM programme at Gothenburg University. 
The task was to recrate some of the String class' functionality without using their respective methods themselves.
It is legal to use .length(), .charAt() and a restriced version of string concatention where 
it is only allowed to append characters to a string (using +), but not entire strings.
