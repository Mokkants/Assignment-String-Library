This code is created for the very first assignment for the SEM programme at Gothenburg University. 
The task was to recreate some of the String class' functionality without using their respective methods.
It is only legal to use .length(), .charAt() and a restricted version of string concatenation where 
it is only allowed to append characters to a string (using +), but not entire strings.
